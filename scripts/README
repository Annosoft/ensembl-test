This directory contains a script "runtests.pl" that is used to run a set 
of test (*.t extension files) present in the directory given as argument
(see example below)

Example of set of tests currently in use can be found e.g. in
ensembl/modules/t or ensembl-compara/modules/t

In order to run the tests, you MUST have a MultiTestDB.conf file in the 
directory where the set of tests to be run are present.
You have an MultiTestDB.conf.example in the current directory that can be
copied to the right place and updated at your convinience.
The file gives the information (username, host, etc.) for a mysql
instance where you have write permission.
Running test case(s) which require a database will automatically create
a temporary database during the test(s) execution.
In case you want to remove the temporary database after all tests, use the -c 
option.

To use the tests you must add the ensembl-test modules to your PERL5LIB 
environment variable.

Example:

setenv PERL5LIB ${PERL5LIB}:${ENSHOME}/ensembl-test/modules
or
PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:${ENSHOME}/ensembl-test/modules

To run multiple tests use the runtests.pl script in ensembl-test/scripts

Examples:

#run all tests in the t directory
runtests.pl t

#run 3 tests
runtests.pl t/gene.t t/exon.t t/densityFeature.t

#run a single test
runtests.pl t/gene.t

#run all tests in the current directory
runtests.pl

#run all tests in the current directory and clean up
runtests.pl -c

The ensembl-test module use standard perl libraries from which you can get some information

perldoc Test
perldoc Test::Harness
