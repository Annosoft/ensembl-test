dump_test_schema.pl requires the following modules, which cpanm should
be capable of installing:

  MooseX::App::Simple
  DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader
  SQL::Translator

These have more than a few dependencies!

DBD::mysql is also required but if you're using the EnsEMBL API you
probably have that already.
